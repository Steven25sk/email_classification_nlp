# email_classification_nlp

Classifying email into spam or not spam by using Deep Learning Algorithm ( Natural Language Processing ), and applying text-preprocessing to reduce slang words, unused characters, etc.

As of now it is a technology era, most of the promotions/advertisements, schedule, appointments, and others are sent by email. Some of them are spam and mostly go to our inbox, which are not detected automatically by the mail. Therefore I have created an email classification using NLP to classify whether the email is spam or not.
